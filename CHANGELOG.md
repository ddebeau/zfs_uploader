## [0.6.0](https://github.com/ddebeau/zfs_uploader/compare/0.5.0...0.6.0) 2021-08-29

### Changed

- Add `max_incremental_backups_per_full` config option. Setting the option 
  allows for multiple full backups. Do not set option for one full backup 
  and one or more incremental backups.
[#29](https://github.com/ddebeau/zfs_uploader/issues/29)

- Replace `max_incremental_backups` config option with `max_backups`, to 
  avoid having to set a limit for incremental and full backups. Full 
  backups are only removed when there are no dependent incremental backups.
  
### Fixed

- Remove `misfire_grace_time` so that jobs always run if they are late.
